<summary> &nbsp; üìñ &nbsp; Day 3 - Exploring Analytics Engineering, ETL vs ELT, and dbt for Data Transformation </summary>

>  üóìÔ∏è &nbsp; Date: 2023-02-22  &nbsp; &nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; üîñ &nbsp; Resource: [Fundamentals of Dbt](https://courses.getdbt.com/courses/fundamentals)	

<p align="justify">
Today, I learned a bit about analytical engineers, ETL vs ELT and dbt for data transformation. I understood the difference between data engineer and analytical engineer. Data Engineers are responsible for designing and maintaining the infrastructure that enables the storage, processing, and analysis of large volumes of data whereas Analytics Engineers focus on building the analytical infrastructure that enables data-driven decision making. 
</p>
  
<p align="justify">
ETL and ELT are two different approaches to building data pipelines. ELT has become more popular in recent years due to the increasing availability of powerful cloud-based data warehouses, such as Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, and Snowflake. The main difference between the two approaches is the order in which the transformations are performed. ETL performs transformations on the data before it is loaded into the target system, while ELT loads the data into the target system first and then performs transformations on the data as needed.
</p>

<p align="justify">
dbt (data build tool) is a popular open-source tool that is used to manage data transformation pipelines. It is specifically designed for ELT workflows and provides features such as version control, testing, and documentation for data transformation code. dbt allows analytics engineers to manage the data transformation process in a more scalable and efficient way.
</p>
  
<p align="justify">
Next, I will dive deeper into dbt and explore this powerful too.

<p align="justify">
Today, I learned about data orchestration, fact models, dimension models, and DAG. I also explored the history of data modeling, including the Star schema, Kimball, and Data Vault. I learned that denormalized modeling, agile analytics, and ad hoc analytics are the latest trends in data modeling. I also learned why marts are called marts, and the differences between materialized tables and views.
</p>
  
<p align="justify">
In addition, I learned that models are .sql files that live in the models folder and that modularity is the degree to which a system's components may be separated and recombined. I also explored the concept of Sources, Staging, Intermediate, Fact, and Dimension models. I learned about upstream and downstream dependencies and the importance of data freshness in dbt.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I learned about the importance of modularity in dbt and how it allows for easy separation and recombination of system components. I also learned about the ref macro, which allows for easy reference to other models in the project. Testing is an essential aspect of data transformation, and dbt has features that allow for testing at multiple levels. There are two types of tests in dbt: singular tests and generic tests. Singular tests are specific queries that run on an entire model, while generic tests are written in YAML and run on specific columns in a model.

<summary> &nbsp; üìñ &nbsp; Day 5 - Measures of Spread in Python </summary>

>  üóìÔ∏è &nbsp; Date: 2023-02-24  &nbsp; &nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; üîñ &nbsp; Resource: [Introduction to Statistics in Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-statistics-in-python)	

<p align="justify">
Today I learned about measures of spread such as variance, standard deviation, and mean absolute deviation in Python. These measures help to understand how much the data is spread out from the mean or central tendency.
</p>

<details> <br>
<summary> &nbsp; Variance and Standard Deviation</summary>
Variance is the average of the squared differences from the mean, while standard deviation is the square root of variance.

<pre><code>
import numpy as np

data = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

var = np.var(data)
std = np.std(data)

print("Variance:", var)
print("Standard Deviation:", std)

## output 
Variance: 8.0
Standard Deviation: 2.8284271247461903

</code></pre>

</details>

<details> <br>

 <summary> &nbsp; Mean Absolute Deviation </summary>
Mean absolute deviation (MAD) is the average of the absolute differences from the mean.

<pre><code>
import numpy as np

data = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

mean = np.mean(data)
mad = np.mean(np.abs(data - mean))

print("Mean Absolute Deviation:", mad)

## output 
Mean Absolute Deviation: 2.4

</code></pre>

</details>

<details>

<summary> &nbsp; Difference between SD and MSD </summary> <br>

The main difference between standard deviation and mean absolute deviation is that the former gives more weight to extreme values in the dataset, whereas the latter treats all deviations equally. Therefore, standard deviation is more sensitive to outliers than mean absolute deviation.

</details>

<details> <br>

<summary> &nbsp; Interquartile Range and Outliers </summary>
Interquartile range (IQR) is the range between the first and third quartiles of the dataset, and it can be used to identify outliers. Any value outside the range of 1.5 times the IQR below the first quartile or above the third quartile is considered an outlier.

<pre><code>
import numpy as np
import scipy.stats as stats

data = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40]

q1, q3 = np.percentile(data, [25, 75])
iqr = q3 - q1

lower_bound = q1 - (1.5 * iqr)
upper_bound = q3 + (1.5 * iqr)

outliers = [x for x in data if x < lower_bound or x > upper_bound]

print("Interquartile Range:", iqr)
print("Outliers:", outliers)


## output 
Interquartile Range: 18.0
Outliers: [2, 40]

<summary> &nbsp; üìñ &nbsp; Day 6 - Discrete probability and sampling  </summary>

>  üóìÔ∏è &nbsp; Date: 2023-02-22  &nbsp; &nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; üîñ &nbsp; Resource: [Datacamp: Random Numbers and Probability](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-statistics-in-python/random-numbers-and-probability-2?ex=1) , [Youtube playlist: Discrete Probability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHcrna8Fk18&list=PLvxOuBpazmsNIHP5cz37oOPZx0JKyNszN)

<p align="justify">
Today, I learned about probability distributions in Python, specifically discrete probability distributions such as the binomial, Poisson, and geometric distributions. I also learned about sampling using the sample() method in Python as sampling is the process of selecting a subset of data from a larger dataset, usually for the purpose of making inferences about the larger population.

</p>
  
<p align="justify">
In Python, we can use the NumPy library to generate random numbers from different probability distributions. For example, we can use the binomial distribution to simulate flipping a coin a certain number of times and counting the number of heads. The binomial distribution takes two parameters: the number of trials (n) and the probability of success (p). The following code generates 100 random numbers from a binomial distribution with n=10 and p=0.5:
</p>


<pre><code>
import numpy as np
binomial_dist = np.random.binomial(n=10, p=0.5, size=100)
</code></pre>

<p align="justify">
Similarly, we can use the Poisson distribution to model the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given the average rate of occurrence. The Poisson distribution takes one parameter: the average rate of occurrence (Œª). The following code generates 100 random numbers from a Poisson distribution with Œª=5:
</p>

<pre><code>
import numpy as np
poisson_dist = np.random.poisson(lam=5, size=100)
</code></pre>

<p align="justify">
Lastly, the geometric distribution models the number of trials needed to achieve the first success in a series of independent trials, each with the same probability of success. The geometric distribution takes one parameter: the probability of success (p). The following code generates 100 random numbers from a geometric distribution with p=0.3:
</p>

<pre><code>
import numpy as np
geometric_dist = np.random.geometric(p=0.3, size=100)
</code></pre>
  
<p align="justify">
In addition to generating random numbers from probability distributions, we can use the sample() method in Python to randomly sample a subset of data from a larger dataset. The sample() method takes one parameter: the sample size. The following code randomly samples 10 values from a list of numbers:
</p>

<pre><code>
import numpy as np
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
sample = np.random.choice(data, size=10, replace=False)
</code></pre>
