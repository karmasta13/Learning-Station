In this course on data governance, I learned about the importance of managing data effectively within organizations.
As someone who has taken a course on data governance, I now understand that it involves creating policies, procedures, and standards for managing an organization's data assets. These policies cover a wide range of areas, including data privacy, data quality, data security, and data access.
</p>
<p align="justify">
One key takeaway from the course was the importance of data governance in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of an organization's data. Data governance policies help to ensure that the data is of high quality and can be trusted to support decision-making processes. Additionally, data governance can help organizations comply with regulatory requirements related to data privacy and security.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Overall, this course on data governance has helped me to appreciate the importance of managing data effectively within organizations. By implementing robust data governance policies, organizations can ensure that their data is accurate, secure, and reliable, and that it can be used effectively to support their goals.

<summary> &nbsp; üìñ &nbsp; Day 2 - Advanced Statistical Techniques </summary>

>  üóìÔ∏è &nbsp; Date: 2023-02-21  &nbsp; &nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; üîñ &nbsp; Resource: [Statistics Foundations 4: Advanced Topics](https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/share?account=57118729&forceAccount=false&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Fstatistics-foundations-4-advanced-topics%3Ftrk%3Dshare_ent_url%26shareId%3DbgrLh5ABQXy0gFkJrRmHGA%253D%253D)	

<p align="justify">
In this advanced statistics course, I gained a deeper understanding of various statistical concepts and techniques that are crucial. One of the most significant takeaways from this course was the importance of experimental design in ensuring the validity of statistical inferences. I learned about different types of experimental designs, such as completely randomized, randomized block, and factorial designs, and how to analyze the data obtained from them using analysis of variance (ANOVA). This knowledge is particularly useful in A/B testing. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
Furthermore, the course covered two-population comparisons, where I learned how to compare means and variances of two populations using different statistical tests, such as t-tests and F-tests. Additionally, the course covered advanced topics such as small sample sizes, t-distribution, degrees of freedom, and statistical power.

<summary> &nbsp; üìñ &nbsp; Day 3 - Exploring Analytics Engineering, ETL vs ELT, and dbt for Data Transformation </summary>

>  üóìÔ∏è &nbsp; Date: 2023-02-22  &nbsp; &nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; üîñ &nbsp; Resource: [Fundamentals of Dbt](https://courses.getdbt.com/courses/fundamentals)	

<p align="justify">
Today, I learned a bit about analytical engineers, ETL vs ELT and dbt for data transformation. I understood the difference between data engineer and analytical engineer. Data Engineers are responsible for designing and maintaining the infrastructure that enables the storage, processing, and analysis of large volumes of data whereas Analytics Engineers focus on building the analytical infrastructure that enables data-driven decision making. 

ETL and ELT are two different approaches to building data pipelines. ELT has become more popular in recent years due to the increasing availability of powerful cloud-based data warehouses, such as Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, and Snowflake. The main difference between the two approaches is the order in which the transformations are performed. ETL performs transformations on the data before it is loaded into the target system, while ELT loads the data into the target system first and then performs transformations on the data as needed.
</p>

<p align="justify">
dbt (data build tool) is a popular open-source tool that is used to manage data transformation pipelines. It is specifically designed for ELT workflows and provides features such as version control, testing, and documentation for data transformation code. dbt allows analytics engineers to manage the data transformation process in a more scalable and efficient way.
</p>
  
<p align="justify">
Next, I will dive deeper into dbt and explore this powerful too.
